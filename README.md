<!-- hopefully will improve -->

Axiol is an advanced, highly customizable, and interactive Discord Bot coded in pure Python.</br>
For any suggestions, the command `suggest` (Starting with the server prefix) can be used, and the suggestion will be sent to the
[Official Discord Support Server](https://discord.gg/Rzz5WS9jXW).</br>

The default prefix is a dot `.` </br>
Make sure to read the [Docs](/DOCS.md)
